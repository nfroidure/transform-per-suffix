## Transform per suffixes

The idea is to recursively traverse a JavaScript object
 tree in order to find some suffixes and apply transformations
 to it.

We choose to use a functionnal signature but for performance
 reasons, we mutate the given object in place. This is then
 your responsibility to ensure that those side effects won't
 mess your app.

[See in context](./index.js#L8-L18)



### Performance tip

To avoid unecessary string comparison, we
        just skip it when the key is shorter than
        the suffix.
